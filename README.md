This is a repository wherein I've put the codes that I worked upon using PyTorch for implementing an attack in the ML model
The paper is added for a better understanding of the code and the working.
The code basically tries to fool the model by degrading the accuracy of the model as this is the case of an untargeted attack implemented upon the FL environment using the PyTorch framework
